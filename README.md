# 10-arm-testbed
Re-implement in Python the results presented in Figure 2.2 of the Sutton &amp; Barto book comparing a greedy  method with two ùúÄ-greedy methods (ùúÄ =0.01 and ùúÄ =0.1), on the 10-armed testbed, and present your code  and results. Include a discussion of the exploration - exploitation dilemma in relation to your findings. 

# Cliff walking
Re-implement in Python the results presented in Figure 6.4 of the Sutton & Barto book comparing SARSA and Q-learning in the cliff-walking task. Investigate the effect of choosing different values for the exploration parameter ÔÅ• for both methods. Present your code and results. In your discussion clearly describe the main difference between SARSA and Q-learning in relation to your findings.
